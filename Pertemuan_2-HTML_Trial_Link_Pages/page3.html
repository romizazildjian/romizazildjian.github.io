  <p align="right"> <strong>Asteroids</strong> are minor planets, especially of the inner Solar System. Larger asteroids
    have also
    been called
    planetoids. These terms have historically been applied to any astronomical object orbiting the Sun that did not
    resolve into a disc in a telescope and was not observed to have characteristics of an active comet such as a tail.
    As minor planets in the outer Solar System were discovered that were found to have volatile-rich surfaces similar to
    comets, these came to be distinguished from the objects found in the main asteroid belt.[1]</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <hr> <br>
  <p align="center">Millions of asteroids exist, many are shattered remnants of planetesimals, bodies within the young
    Sun's solar
    nebula that never grew large enough to become planets.[2] The vast majority of known asteroids orbit within the main
    asteroid belt located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, or are co-orbital with Jupiter (the Jupiter trojans).
    However, other orbital families exist with significant populations, including the near-Earth objects. Individual
    asteroids are classified by their characteristic spectra, with the majority falling into three main groups: C-type,
    M-type, and S-type. These were named after and are generally identified with carbon-rich, metallic, and silicate
    (stony) compositions, respectively. The sizes of asteroids varies greatly; the largest, Ceres, is almost 1,000 km
    (600 mi) across and massive enough to qualify as a dwarf planet. </p>

  <p align="left">Asteroids are somewhat arbitrarily differentiated from comets and meteoroids. In the case of comets,
    the difference
    is one of composition: while asteroids are mainly composed of mineral and rock, comets are primarily composed of
    dust and ice. Furthermore, asteroids formed closer to the sun, preventing the development of cometary ice.[3] The
    difference between asteroids and meteoroids is mainly one of size: meteoroids have a diameter of one meter or less,
    whereas asteroids have a diameter of greater than one meter.[4] Finally, meteoroids can be composed of either
    cometary or asteroidal materials.[5]</p>

  <p align="justify">Only one asteroid, 4 Vesta, which has a relatively reflective surface, is normally visible to the
    naked eye, and
    this is only in very dark skies when it is favorably positioned. Rarely, small asteroids passing close to Earth may
    be visible to the naked eye for a short time.[6] As of March 2020, the Minor Planet Center had data on 930,000 minor
    planets in the inner and outer Solar System, of which about 545,000 had enough information to be given numbered
    designations.[7]</p>
